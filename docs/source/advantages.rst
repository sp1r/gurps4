======================================================= ===================


.. _acute_senses:

Acute Senses
============

- Acute Hearing
- Acute Taste and Smell
- Acute Touch
- Acute Vision

You have superior senses. Each Acute Sense is a separate advantage that gives +1 per level to
all Sense rolls (see ...) you make or the GM makes for you – using that one sense.


.. _ambidexterity:

Ambidexterity
=============

You can fight or otherwise act equally well with either hand, and never suffer the -4 DX
penalty for using the “off” hand (see ...). Should some accident befall one of your arms
or hands, assume it is the left one.



.. _animal_empathy:

Animal Empathy
==============

You are unusually talented at reading the motivations of animals. When you meet
an animal, the GM rolls against your IQ and tells you what you “feel.” This reveals the
beast’s emotional state – friendly, frightened, hostile, hungry, etc. – and whether it
is under supernatural control. You may also use your Influence skills (see ...) on animals
just as you would on sapient beings, which usually ensures a positive reaction.



.. _catfall:

Catfall
=======

You subtract five yards from a fall automatically (treat this as an automatic
Acrobatics success – don’t check again for it). In addition, a successful DX roll
halves damage from any fall (see ...). To enjoy these benefits, your limbs must be unbound
and your body free to twist as you fall.



.. _Charisma:

Charisma
========

You have a natural ability to impress and lead others. Anyone can acquire a
semblance of charisma through looks, manners, and intelligence – but
real charisma is independent of these things. Each level gives +1 on all reaction rolls made by
sapient beings with whom you actively interact (converse, lecture, etc.); +1 to
Influence rolls (see Influence Rolls, ...); and +1 to Leadership and Public Speaking
skills. The GM may rule that your Charisma does not affect members of extremely alien
races.



.. _combat_reflexes:

Combat Reflexes
===============

You have extraordinary reactions, and are rarely surprised for more than a
moment. You get +1 to all active defense rolls (see ...) and +2 to Fright
Checks (see ...). You never “freeze” in a surprise situation, and get +6
on all IQ rolls to wake up, or to recover from surprise or mental “stun.”



.. _danger_sense:

Danger Sense
============

You can’t depend on it, but sometimes you get this prickly feeling right at the back
of your neck, and you know something’s wrong... The GM rolls once against your
Perception, secretly, in any situation involving an ambush, impending disaster, or
similar hazard. On a success, you get enough of a warning that you can take action. A roll of
3 or 4 means you get a little detail as to the nature of the danger.



.. _daredevil:

Daredevil
=========

Fortune seems to smile on you when you take risks! Any time you take an
unnecessary risk (in the GM’s opinion), you get a +1 to all skill rolls. Furthermore, you may
reroll any critical failure that occurs during such high-risk behavior.



.. _empathy:

Empathy
=======

You have a “feeling” for people. When you first meet someone – or are reunited
after an absence – you may ask the GM to roll against your IQ. He will tell you
what you “feel” about that person. On a failed IQ roll, he will lie!
This talent is excellent for spotting imposters, possession, etc., and for
determining the true loyalties of NPCs.


.. _enhanced_defenses:

Enhanced Defenses
=================

You are unusually adept at evading attacks! This may be due to careful
observation of your foe, focusing chi, or anything else that fits your background.
There are three versions:
**Enhanced Block**: You have +1 to your Block score with Shield skill.
**Enhanced Dodge**: You have +1 to your Dodge score.
**Enhanced Parry**: You have +1 to your Parry score. You may take this advantage
for bare hands (5 points), for any one Melee Weapon skill (5 points), or for
all parries (10 points).




.. _fearlessness:

Fearlessness
============

You are difficult to frighten or intimidate! Add your level of Fearlessness to your
Will whenever you make a Fright Check or must resist the Intimidation skill (see ...) or
a supernatural power that induces fear. You also subtract your Fearlessness level from
all Intimidation rolls made against you.



.. _flexibility:

Flexibility
===========

Your body is unusually flexible. This advantage comes in two levels:
**Flexibility**: You get +3 on Climbing rolls; on Escape rolls to get free of ropes,
handcuffs, and similar restraints. You may ignore up to -3 in penalties for
working in close quarters (including many Explosives and Mechanic rolls).
**Double-Jointed**: As above, but more so. You cannot stretch or squeeze yourself
abnormally, but any part of your body may bend any way. You get +5 on
Climbing, Escape rolls, and on attempts to break free. You may ignore up to
-5 in penalties for close quarters.



.. _hard_to_kill:

Hard to Kill
============

You are incredibly difficult to kill. Each level of Hard to Kill gives +1 to HT rolls
made for survival at -HP or below, and on any HT roll where failure means instant
death (due to heart failure, poison, etc.). If this bonus makes the difference between
success and failure, you collapse, apparently dead (or disabled), but come to in the
usual amount of time (see ...)



.. _high_pain_threshold:

High Pain Threshold
===================

You are as susceptible to injury as anyone else, but you don’t feel it as much. You
never suffer a shock penalty when you are injured. In addition, you get +3 on all HT
rolls to avoid knockdown and stunning – and if you are tortured physically, you get
+3 to resist. The GM may let you roll at Will+3 to ignore pain in other situations.



.. _language_talent:

Language Talent
===============

You have a knack for languages. When you learn a language at a comprehension
level above None, you automatically function at the next higher level.


.. _magery:

Magery
======

You are magically adept. This advantage comes in levels. You must
purchase Magery 0 before buying higher levels of Magery.

**Magery 0:**
This is basic “magical awareness,” a prerequisite for learning magic in most worlds. The GM
makes a Sense roll (...) when you first see a magic item, and again when
you first touch it. On a success, you intuitively know that the item is macical.
A roll of 3 or 4 also tells you whether the magic is helpful or dangerous,
and about how strong it is. Those without Magery do not get this roll!

**Magery 1+:**
Higher levels of Magery make it much easier to learn and use magic. Add your Magery to IQ when
you learn spells. For instance, if you have IQ 14, Magery 3 lets you learn
spells as if you had IQ 17. Add your Magery level to Perception when you
roll to sense magic items, and to IQ when you learn Thaumatology skill.

Reduce the time required to learn new spells in play (but not the point cost)
by 10% per Magery level, to a minimum of 60% of the usual time at Magery 4.
For instance, with Magery 3, you would learn spells in 70% the usual time.

Powerful spells require a minimum level of Magery as a prerequisite, so be
sure to skim the Spell List when deciding how much Magery you need. Note that high
Magery lets you produce powerful results with even the most basic spells;
see Magery and Effect (...). The GM sets the maximum Magery allowed to
PCs. Magery 3 is about right for “classic fantasy.”


.. _night_vision:

Night Vision
============

Your eyes adapt rapidly to darkness. Each level of this ability (maximum nine
levels) allows you to ignore -1 in combat or vision penalties due to darkness, provided
there is at least some light.



.. _perfect_balance:

Perfect Balance
===============

You can always keep your footing, no matter how narrow the walking surface
(tightrope, ledge, tree limb, etc.), under normal conditions without having to make
a die roll. If the surface is wet, slippery, or unstable, you get +6 on all rolls to keep your
feet. In combat, you get +4 to DX and DX-based skill rolls to keep your feet or avoid
being knocked down. Finally, you get +1 to Acrobatics and Climbing skill.



.. _resistant:

Resistant
=========

You are naturally resistant (or even immune) to diseases or poisons. This gives
you a bonus on all HT rolls to resist incapacitation or injury from such things.
**Resistant to Disease**: You may take a +3 bonus for 3 points or a +8 bonus for 5.
**Resistant to Poison**: You have a +3 bonus



.. _talent:

Talent
======

You have a natural aptitude for a set of closely related skills. “Talents” come in
levels, and give a bonus of +1 per level with all affected skills, even for default use. This
effectively raises your attribute scores for the purpose of those skills only;
thus, this is an inexpensive way to be adept at small class of skills.
You may never have more than four levels of a particular Talent. However,
overlapping Talents can give skill bonuses (only) in excess of +4.
The cost of a Talent depends on the size of the group of skills affected. Some examples:
**Artificer** covers Armoury, Electronics, Repair, Engineer, Mechanic, and others.
**Outdoorsman** covers Camoflage, Naturalist, Navigation, Survival, and Tracking.
**Smooth Operator** covers all Influence skills, as well as Acting, Carousing,
Leadership, and Public Speaking.
There are many other possibilities! GMs are encouraged to create their own Talents as needed.



.. _Voice:

Voice
=====

You have a naturally clear, resonant, and attractive voice. This gives you +2 with any
skill that depends on speaking or singing (with the GM’s approval, of course). You
also get +2 on any reaction roll made by someone who can hear your voice.
