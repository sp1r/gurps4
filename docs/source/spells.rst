.. _purify_air:

Purify Air
==========

| **Prerequisite**: None
| **Classes**: Area
| **Duration**: Works instantly. Purification is permanent.
| **Base Cost**: 1. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

This spell removes all impurities from the air in its area of effect. It is
often used to neutralize the effects of poisonous gas or vapors. Note that a
room full of smoke may safely be purified one section at a time – but truly
deadly vapors must all be removed at once, or some may escape.
This spell also turns old “stale” air into fresh breathable air. The air in a
one-yard radius, if not renewed from the outside, will last 45 minutes for
one person at rest, less for multiple persons or someone violently
exercising (GM’s discretion)



.. _create_air:

Create Air
==========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Purify Air <purify_air>`
| **Classes**: Area
| **Duration**: Breeze, bubbles, etc. last 5 seconds. Air created is permanent.
| **Base Cost**: 1. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

This spell manufactures air where none exists. When cast where there is
already air, it produces an outward breeze lasting about five seconds.
When cast in a vacuum, it instantly creates breathable air. When cast
within earth, stone, or other material, it fills any empty spaces with air, but
does not burst the stone. When cast underwater, it makes bubbles!
It cannot be cast inside a living being.



.. _shape_air:

Shape Air
=========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Create Air <purify_air>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 1 to 10. 1 produces a gentle breeze; 4 a wind; 6 a heavy wind; 8 or
more a violent blast. Cost to maintain is the same as to cast.

This spell lets the caster create movements of air over a small area.
The caster must choose a starting point (calculate distance penalties to
that point). The wind starts there and blows in a stream one yard wide, for a
distance in yards equal to 5 times the energy put into the spell, and then
dissipates. This may cause knockback (see Knockback, p. 378) on someone it
hits; each second, roll 1d per full 2 points of energy in the spell. Treat this
as damage for knockback purposes only (this spell does not cause injury).



.. _no_smell:

No-Smell
========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Purify Air <purify_air>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: 1 hour.
| **Cost**: 2; same to maintain.

Removes the subject’s odor and makes it (or him) totally undetectable
by smell. Any possessions are also affected. This spell changes no other
properties of the subject.



.. _predict_weather:

Predict Weather
===============

| **Prerequisite**: At least four Air spells.
| **Cost**: Twice the length of the forecast, in days. Double the cost for a location outside the general area (say, over the horizon). Quadruple the cost for a place on another continent. This spell cannot predict weather on other planets or planes.
| **Time to cast**: 5 seconds per day forecast.

Lets the caster forecast the weather accurately for a given location over a
given time. This forecast does not take magical meddling into account, or
predict the actions of other wizards!



.. _breathe_water:

Breathe Water
=============

| **Prerequisites**: :ref:`Create Air <create_air>` and :ref:`Destroy water <destroy_water>`
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 4 to cast; 2 to maintain.

Lets the subject breathe water as though it were air. Subject does
not lose the ability to breathe ordinary air! This spell is also considered a Water
spell.



.. _walk_on_air:

Walk on Air
===========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Shape Air <shape_air>`
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 3 to cast; 2 to maintain.

Temporarily grants the subject the Walk on Air advantage (...). If the
subject falls for any reason (e.g., injury), the spell is broken! If the spell
is recast immediately, he falls for only one second (about 5 yards) and then
“lands” on the air (taking 1d damage) – unless he hits ground before then. If
he’s 10 feet over a lava pit, too bad!




.. _earth_to_air:

Earth to Air
============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Create Air <create_air>` and :ref:`Shape Earth <shape_earth>`
| **Duration**: Permanent.
| **Cost**: 1 to transform one cubic foot of earth/stone to air, giving enough air for one person to breathe for 1 minute. To transform larger quantities of earth/stone at once, the cost is 5 per cubic yard.
| **Time to cast**: 2 seconds.

This spell turns earth or stone into air, which can be valuable to someone
who is trapped underground! The more energy the caster spends, the
more earth he can transform, but he is limited to regular shapes with the
largest dimension no more than four times the smallest one. This spell is
also considered an Earth spell.




.. _stench:

Stench
======

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Purify Air <purify_air>`
| **Duration**: 5 minutes, except in windy areas.
| **Base Cost**: 1. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

Produces a cloud of vile, yellowish gas that reeks of brimstone. Until it
dissipates, anyone who breathes it must make a HT roll or take 1d damage.
Roll once per minute. Those in the area also begin to suffocate (see Suffocation ...).
The cloud is heavy, and “rolls” downhill if the ground is not level. The rate of
dissipation depends on the area and presence of wind; indoors, it usually lasts
until the spell expires, but outdoors on a windy day, it might only last 10 seconds or so.




.. _lightning:

Lightning
=========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 1 <magery>` and at least six other Air spells.
| **Cost**: Any amount up to your Magery level per second, for three seconds. The bolt does 1d-1 burning damage per energy point.
| **Time to cast**: 1 to 3 seconds (the caster’s fingers sparkle as the spell builds up).

Lets the caster shoot a bolt of lightning from his fingertip.
This has 1/2D 50, Max 100, Acc 3. Treat any metal
armor as DR 1 against this spell! If the target is wounded, he must make a HT
roll, at -1 per 2 HP suffered, or be stunned. He may attempt a HT roll
each turn thereafter to recover. Against electronic equipment, treat
this attack as if it had the Surge damage modifier (see Surge, ...).
Lightning behaves unpredictably around conductors. A lightning bolt
cannot be fired through a metal grid, between bars, from within a car, etc. –
it jumps to the metal and is lost. However, the GM may (for instance)
allow a wizard to shoot a lightning bolt into a metal floor. This would not
electrocute those on it, but could shock them all, interrupting
concentration and doing slight damage (no more than 1 point, and possibly none
at all). The GM may encourage creative use of lightning until it becomes
a nuisance ...

.. _itch:

Itch
====

| **Prerequisite**: None
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT
| **Duration**: Until the subject takes a turn to scratch.
| **Cost**: 2. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

Causes the subject to itch fiercely in a spot of the caster’s choice. The
subject is at -2 DX until he takes one full turn to scratch (more, if armor,
etc. is in the way!). Only one Itch spell can affect a given subject at a time.



.. _spasm:

Spasm
=====

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Itch <itch>`
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT
| **Duration**: A moment.
| **Cost**: 2. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

Can be directed against any of the subject’s voluntary
muscles. Directed against a hand, it causes the subject to
drop whatever he is holding (usually a weapon). If the subject is in the middle
of a lengthy spell requiring gestures, he must make a DX roll or start
over. Ingenious casters will find other uses...



.. _pain:

Pain
====

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Spasm <spasm>`
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT
| **Duration**: 1 second.
| **Cost**: 2. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

The subject feels a stab of agonizing pain. He must make a Will roll to
avoid crying out. If he is in a precarious position (climbing, for instance),
he must make a DX roll to avoid catastrophe! His DX and all DX-based skills
are at -3 for the next turn only. If the subject is in the middle of a spell
requiring gestures, he must roll vs. Will or start over. High Pain Threshold
gives +3 to the Will and DX rolls above; Low Pain Threshold gives -4.



.. _clumsiness:

Clumsiness
==========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Spasm <spasm>`
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 1 to 5 to cast; half that amount to maintain (round up).

The subject suffers -1 to his DX and DX-based skills for every point of
energy put into the spell.



.. _hinder:

Hinder
======

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Clumsiness <clumsiness>` or :ref:`Haste <haste>`
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 1 to 4 to cast; same to maintain.

The subject is at -1 to his Move and Dodge scores for every point of energy
put into the spell. This spell is also considered a Movement spell.



.. _rooted_feet:

Rooted Feet
===========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Hinder <hinder>`
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by ST
| **Duration**: 1 minute, or until subject breaks free.
| **Cost**: 3. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

The subject’s feet are glued in place! He may try another resistance
roll at -5 every turn, against the original spell skill roll, to break free. While
the spell continues, the subject’s skill with any weapon except a ranged
weapon is at -2 and his Dodge score is cut in half (round down).



.. _paralyze_limb:

Paralyze Limb
=============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 1 <magery>` and five Body Control spells, including :ref:`Pain <pain>`
| **Classes**: Melee; Resisted by HT
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 3. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

The caster must strike the subject on a limb to trigger this spell (hits elsewhere
have no effect). Armor does not protect. Resolve resistance on contact.
If the caster wins, the subject’s limb is paralyzed; it is considered crippled for
one minute.



.. _wither_limb:

Wither Limb
===========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 2 <magery>` and :ref:`Paralyze Limb <paralyze_limb>`
| **Classes**: Melee; Resisted by HT
| **Duration**: Permanent unless healed magically.
| **Cost**: 5.

The caster must strike the subject on a limb to trigger this spell.
Armor does not protect. Resolve resistance on contact. If the caster wins, the subject’s
limb withers immediately; it is crippled for all purposes. The subject also takes 1d damage.



.. _deathtouch:

Deathtouch
==========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Wither Limb <wither_limb>`
| **Classes**: Melee
| **Cost**: 1 to 3.

The caster must strike the subject to trigger this spell; hit location is
irrelevant. The subject takes 1d damage per point of energy in the spell.
Armor does not protect. This spell does affect the undead.

=============================================== ======================= =========================================== ================================

.. _sense_foes:

Sense Foes
==========

| **Prerequisite**: None
| **Classes**: Information; Area
| **Base Cost**: 1 (minimum 2).

Tells the caster if the subject has hostile intent, and what the degree of
hostility is. Can be cast on one person or a whole area. If cast over an area,
this spell only detects that someone is hostile, without telling who.



.. _sense_emotion:

Sense Emotion
=============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Sense Foes <sense_foes>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Cost**: 2.

Lets the caster know what emotions the subject is feeling at the
moment. It works on any living being, but is not much use except on sapient
creatures! This also tells how loyal the subject is to the caster (see
Loyalty of Hirelings, ...).



.. _truthsayer:

Truthsayer
==========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Sense Emotion <sense_emotion>`
| **Classes**: Information; Resisted by Will
| **Cost**: 2.

This tells whether the subject is lying or not. May be cast in two ways:
1. To tell whether the subject has told any lies in the last five minutes.
2. To tell whether the last thing the subject said was a lie. May also give an indication of how
great the lie is. If the caster is not touching the subject, calculate range
as for a Regular spell.



.. _mind_reading:

Mind-Reading
============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Truthsayer <truthsayer>`
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by Will
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 4 to cast; 2 to maintain.
| **Time to cast**: 10 seconds.

Lets the caster read the subject’s mind. Works on any living being, but
is most useful on sapient creatures. Detects only surface thoughts (what
the subject is thinking at that moment). The subject is not aware his
mind is being read, except in the case of a critical failure. Modifiers: -
2 if the caster does not know the subject’s native language; -2 if the subject
is of a different race – or -4 or more if the subject is totally alien!




.. _hide_thoughts:

Hide Thoughts
=============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Truthsayer <truthsayer>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: 10 minutes.
| **Cost**: 3 to cast; 1 to maintain.

This spell resists all mind-reading and thought-control attempts on the
subject. The “attacking” ability must win a Quick Contest against this spell
in order to affect the subject. If the attacking ability pierces Hide
Thoughts, the subject still gets his normal resistance roll (roll separately).
This spell does not affect previously established mental control.

=============================================== ======================= =========================================== ================================

.. _seek_earth:

Seek Earth
==========

| **Prerequisite**: None
| **Classes**: Information
| **Cost**: 3.
| **Time to cast**: 10 seconds.

This spell tells the caster the direction and approximate distance of the nearest
significant amount of any one type of earth, metal, or stone. Use the
long-distance modifiers (...). Any known sources of that material may
be excluded if the caster specifically mentions them before beginning.



.. _shape_earth:

Shape Earth
===========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Seek Earth <seek_earth>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 1 per cubic yard of earth shaped (minimum 2); half that to maintain (round up).

Lets the caster move earth and shape it into any form. If the form is
stable (e.g., a hill), it remains permanently after shaping. An unstable form
(e.g., a column or wall) lasts only while the spell continues – no special
concentration is required – and then collapses.

Earth moved with this spell travels at only Move 2. It can harm no one
except by flowing over an immobile person and burying him. If earth is
moved onto a person to bury him – or from beneath him, to create a hole –
he may move normally on his next turn, to escape. He is trapped only if
he fails to do so.

Anyone buried by this spell may try to claw his way out of the loose earth.
One roll, at ST-4, is allowed per turn. GMs may make this roll harder if the
victim is buried under more than two cubic yards of earth! The victim can
hold his breath (see Holding Your Breath, ...), but he eventually risks
suffocation (see Suffocation, ...).


.. _earth_to_stone:

Earth to Stone
==============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 1 <magery>` and :ref:`Shape Earth <shape_earth>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: Permanent.
| **Cost**: 3 per cubic yard (minimum 3).

Turns an item of earth or clay into hard stone (but not gemstone).



.. _create_earth:

Create Earth
============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Earth to Stone <earth_to_stone>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: Permanent.
| **Cost**: 2 per cubic yard to create earth from nothingness (minimum 2); 1 per cubic yard to solidify mud into good earth (minimum 1).

Lets the caster create good, solid earth where none existed before. This
earth must be created in contact with the ground – not hanging in the air or
floating in the sea!



.. _flesh_to_stone:

Flesh to Stone
==============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Earth to Stone <earth_to_stone>`
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT
| **Duration**: Permanent, unless reversed by Stone to Flesh.
| **Cost**: 10.
| **Time to cast**: 2 seconds.

“Petrifies” a living subject (and all his gear!), turning him to stone. Must
affect the entire subject.



.. _stone_to_earth:

Stone to Earth
==============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Earth to Stone <earth_to_stone>` or any 4 Earth spells
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: Permanent.
| **Cost**: 6 per cubic yard (minimum 6).

Turns any kind of stone (including gemstone) into simple earth. Must be
cast on a whole stone or block, rather than a part of it.



.. _stone_to_flesh:

Stone to Flesh
==============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 2 <magery>`, :ref:`Flesh to Stone <flesh_to_stone>` and :ref:`Stone to Earth <stone_to_earth>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: Permanent.
| **Cost**: 10.
| **Time to cast**: 5 seconds.

Reverses the effects of Flesh to Stone and brings the victim back to life
(stunned). Cannot be used to animate a statue that was never alive.




.. _entombment:

Entombment
==========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 2 <magery>` and 5 Earth spells.
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT
| **Duration**: Permanent, unless reversed by this spell.
| **Cost**:  10 (but only 6 to reverse an entombment).
| **Time to cast**: 3 seconds.

The earth instantly swallows the subject. He remains in suspended
animation, in a tiny spherical chamber 50 feet underground, until rescued
by tunneling or the reverse of this spell. A mage who casts Entombment
on himself may elect to stay awake, but this is unwise unless he also
knows Earth to Air!

seconds.

3 – for an effect as though a blowtorch had been held to the subject:
ignites dry firewood or clothes being worn in one second, leather in two
seconds, heavy wood in six seconds.

4 – for an effect as though burning magnesium or phosphorus had been
held to the subject: ignites coal in one second, heavy wood in two seconds.

Cost to maintain is the same as the original cost to cast.

This spell produces a single spot of heat, and is used to set fire to a
readily flammable object. It works best on paper and cloth, and cannot affect any
item that would not burn in an ordinary fire. In particular, it cannot set
fire to a living being! Once ignited, the fire burns normally.




.. _create_fire:

Create Fire
===========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Ignite Fire <ignite_fire>`
| **Classes**: Area
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Base Cost**: 2; half that to maintain. Ordinary fires set by this spell do not require maintenance.

Fills the area of effect with fire that requires no fuel (if cast in midair, it
produces a sphere of flame, which falls to the ground). This is real fire,
and will eventually ignite any flammable objects it touches. Cannot be cast
within rock, foes, etc.



.. _shape_fire:

Shape Fire
==========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Ignite Fire <ignite_fire>`
| **Classes**: Area
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Base Cost**: 2; half that to maintain.

Lets the caster control the shape of any flame. Each shape change requires
a second of concentration. Once shaped, the flame keeps that shape
until the spell expires, without concentration. Moving a flame requires constant
concentration (the flame moves at Move 5, on the caster’s turn). A natural
fire cannot move to a place that it can’t burn, but flame made with the
Create Fire spell needs no fuel and can move almost anywhere.

Flame shaped with this spell normally retains its volume. If the fire is
“spread out” across twice its original area, it only does half damage; if
spread across three times its original area, it does 1/3 damage, and so on.



.. _deflect_energy:

Deflect Energy
==============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 2 <magery>` and :ref:`Shape Fire <shape_fire>`
| **Classes**: Blocking
| **Cost**: 1.

Deflects one energy attack about to hit the subject – including a beam
weapon attack or a Fireball or Lightning spell. Counts as a parry for
combat purposes. If the caster is not the subject, apply distance modifiers as
for a Regular spell. Deflected attacks may still hit a target beyond the subject.



.. _extinguish_fire:

Extinguish Fire
===============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Ignite Fire <ignite_fire>`
| **Classes**: Area
| **Duration**: Once out, a fire stays out.
| **Base Cost**: 3.

Puts out all ordinary and magical fires in its area of effect. Has no effect
on molten steel, lava, plasma, etc.



.. _heat:

Heat
====

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Create Fire <create_fire>` and :ref:`Shape Fire <shape_fire>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: 1 minute. Each minute raises the target’s temperature by 20°. Maximum temperature possible with this spell is 2,800°.
| **Cost**: 1 for an object up to the size of a fist, 2 for an object up to one cubic yard, and 2 per cubic yard for a larger object. Temperature change can be doubled to 40° per minute for double cost, tripled to 60°  per minute for triple cost, and so on. Slower heating costs no less. Same cost to maintain.
| **Time to cast**: 1 minute.

This spell raises the temperature of an object. It does not necessarily produce
fire, though most things burn if heated enough. Heat radiates away
normally. (Use this as a guideline for playable effects – don’t try to turn the
spell into a physics exercise!)

Any wizard planning to make extensive use of this
spell should arm himself with a list of the melting points of various materials. The spell
can have drawbacks. If you were in jail, you might melt your way through
the bars ... but the radiated heat would probably broil you first.



.. _cold:

Cold
====

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Heat <heat>`
| **Classes**: Regular

Duration, Cost, and Time to cast: As for :ref:`Heat <heat>`, except each minute
lowers the target’s temperature by 20°.

This spell is the reverse of Heat (above). It can reduce the temperature
of any object to absolute zero, if maintained for long enough.



.. _resist_cold:

Resist Cold
===========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Heat <heat>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 2 to cast; 1 to maintain. Cost doubles if subject must resist cold of -40° or more; cost triples if subject must resist the cold of absolute zero.

The subject (person, creature, or object) and anything he carries
become immune to the effects of cold and frostbite (but not falling ice,
magical ice spears, etc.).



.. _resist_fire:

Resist Fire
===========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Extinguish Fire <extinguish_fire>` and :ref:`Cold <cold>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 2 to cast; 1 to maintain. Cost doubles if subject must resist a blast furnace or volcano; cost triples if subject must resist the heat of a star, nuclear bomb, etc. Only the first level of protection is necessary against combat-type Fire spells.

The subject (person, creature, or object) and anything he carries
become immune to the effects of heat and fire (but not electricity).



.. _fireball:

Fireball
========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 2 <magery>`, :ref:`Create Fire <create_fire>` and :ref:`Shape Fire <shape_fire>`
| **Classes**: Missile
| **Cost**: Any amount up to your Magery level per second, for three seconds. The fireball does 1d burning damage per energy point.
| **Time to cast**: 1 to 3 seconds.

Lets the caster throw a ball of fire from his hand. This has 1/2D 25, Max
50, Acc 1. When it strikes something, it vanishes in a puff of flame. This spell is
likely to ignite flammable targets.


.. _explosive_fireball:

Explosive Fireball
==================

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Fireball <fireball>`
| **Classes**: Missile
| **Cost**: Any amount up to twice your Magery level per second, for three seconds. The fireball does 1d burning damage per full 2 points of energy.
| **Time to cast**: 1 to 3 seconds.

Creates a fireball that affects both its target and things nearby. This has
1/2D 25, Max 50, Acc 1. Can be thrown at a wall, floor, etc. (at +4 to hit) to
catch foes in the blast. The target and anyone closer to the target than one
yard take full damage. Those further away divide damage by 3 times their
distance in yards (round down).

.. _planar_summon:

Planar Summons
==============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 1 <magery>` and at least one
| **Classes**: Special
| **Cost**: 1 point per 10 character points used to build the summoned entity. Minimum energy cost is 20 (although this will not always sum-mon a 200-point being). The GM secretly determines the capabilities of all summoned creatures
| **Time to cast**: 5 minutes.

Summons a creature, such as a demon or a Thing Man Was Not Meant To Know, from another
plane of existence. The GM determines the predisposition and abilities of this being.
Each plane requires a different Planar Summons spell. Some exceptionally potent entities
might require their own unique spells!

When the creature appears, the cast-er must immediately
try to control it. Treat this as a Quick Contest between the caster’s Planar Summons skill
and the entity’s Will. The caster is at +4 if he knows the creature’s “true name.”

If the caster wins, he can give the creature a single command, which it must carry out. On
completing this task – or after one hour in any event – the entity usually vanishes. However,
some powerful entities can stay for as long as they wish . . .

If the caster ties or loses, the crea-ture reacts badly. An “evil” being com-mits violence or
vandalism, while a “good” one is more likely to depart in a huff and put in a bad word with the
caster’s gods. Wild or chaotic creatures are liable to engage in theft and mis-chief. Extremely
alien entities might react in disturbing and unpredictable ways.


.. _plane_shift:

Plane Shift (VH)
================

| **Prerequisite**: Planar Summons for the same plane.
| **Classes**: Special
| **Duration**: Permanent.
| **Cost**: 20.
| **Time to cast**: 5 seconds.

This spell bodily transports the caster – along with anything he is carrying (up to Heavy encumbrance)
– to a particular plane of existence. Each plane requires its own Plane Shift spell. This is a one-way
trip. To get back, the caster must know Plane Shift for his home plane or get a wizard in the other plane
to cast :ref:`Banish <banish>` on him.

This spell gives the caster no special immunity to his surroundings. To safely visit a plane where the
natural conditions are vacuum, flame, etc., you must learn the necessary protective spells.

*******
Healing
*******

Anyone who tries to heal himself has a skill penalty equal to the amount of injury he has. For example,
a wizard who is missing 4 HP rolls at -4 to heal himself.

A critical failure with a Healing spell always has some appropriate bad effect on the patient, aggravating
the injury, creating a new wound, or the like.

=============================================== ======================= =========================================== ================================


.. _lend_energy:

Lend Energy
===========

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 1 <magery>` or Empathy.
| **Classes**: Regular

Restores the subject’s lost Fatigue
Points, at an energy cost to the caster.
Cannot increase the subject’s FP score
above its normal maximum.
Cost: Any amount; the energy spent
by the caster goes to the subject as
restored FP (e.g., if the caster spends 5
energy, the subject regains 5 lost FP).
Casting cost is not reduced by high
skill.

.. _lend_vitability:

Lend Vitality
=============


| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Lend Energy <lend_energy>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: 1 hour.
| **Cost**: Any amount; the energy spent by the caster goes to the subject as restored HP (e.g., if the caster spends 5 energy, the subject regains 5 lost HP). Casting cost is not reduced by high skill. *Cannot be maintained; must be recast.*

Temporarily restores the subject’s lost Hit Points, at an energy cost to the
caster. Cannot increase the subject’s HP score above its normal maximum.
Since restored HP vanish after one hour and the spell cannot be maintained,
this spell is only a stopgap measure.

.. _recover_energy:

Recover Energy
==============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 1 <magery>` and :ref:`Lend Energy <lend_energy>`
| **Classes**: Special
| **Cost**: None.


This spell allows the caster to rest and recover Fatigue Points more
quickly than normal by drawing energy from the mana around him. A normal
person recovers 1 FP every 10 minutes. A mage who knows this spell at skill
15 or higher recovers 1 FP every 5 minutes. A mage who knows this spell at
skill 20 or higher recovers 1 FP every 2 minutes. No further improvement is
possible. Note that this spell works on the caster himself; it cannot restore FP to others.

The mage must rest quietly, but no ritual or die roll is required. While
resting, he can maintain ordinary spells, but not those that require concentration.

This spell does not function in low- or no-mana areas.

.. _awaken:

Awaken
======

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Lend Vitality <lend_vitability>`
| **Classes**: Area
| **Base Cost**: 1.

This spell renders the subject(s) awake and alert. It instantly counters
the effects of stunning. If the subject is very fatigued (less than 1/3 basic
FP), this spell renders him alert for an hour but costs him 1 FP at the end of
that time. It has no effect on those with 0 or fewer FP. Sleeping or unconscious
subjects get a HT roll to awaken, at a bonus equal to the caster’s
margin of success. A subject rolls at -3 if unconscious due to injury, at -6 if
drugged.

.. _minor_healing:

Minor Healing
=============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Lend Vitality <lend_vitability>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Cost**: 1 to 3. The same amount is restored to the subject.

Restores up to 3 HP to the subject. Does not eliminate disease or poison,
but cures the damage they cause. This spell is risky when used more
than once per day by the same caster on the same subject. If you try, roll at
-3 for the first repetition, -6 for the second, and so on.

If you have the Physician skill at level 15 or higher, a critical failure with
this spell counts only as an ordinary failure – unless you are trying the
spell more than once per day on the same subject.


.. _major_healing:

Major Healing (VH)
==================

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 1 <magery>` and :ref:`Minor Healing <minor_healing>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Cost**: 1 to 4. Twice the amount spent is restored to the subject.

Restores up to 8 HP to the subject. Does not eliminate disease or poison,
but cures the damage they cause. Otherwise, this spell functions just
like :ref:`Minor Healing <minor_healing>`: it is at -3 per casting on the same subject in one day,
and Physician skill at level 15 or higher mitigates the effects of a critical
failure.

The penalties for repeated casting accrue separately for :ref:`Minor Healing <minor_healing>`
and Major Healing. For instance, a caster could cast both spells on the
same subject in the same day at no penalty.

.. _great_healing:

Great Healing (VH)
==================

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 3 <magery>` and :ref:`Major Healing <major_healing>`.
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Cost**: 20. One try per day per subject.
| **Time to cast**: 1 minute.


Restores all of the subject’s missing HP. Does not eliminate disease or poison,
nor does it restore crippled or missing body parts, but it can heal HP lost to any
of these things.

A given subject can only benefit from this spell once per day, whether cast by the same
caster or by a differ ent caster each time.

If you have the Physician skill at level 15 or higher, a critical failure with this
spell counts only as an ordinary failure.


*********
Knowledge
*********

These spells provide information. Duration is “instantaneous” unless

.. _detect_magic:

Detect Magic
============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 1 <magery>`
| **Classes** : Regular
| **Cost**: 2
| **Time to cast**: 5 seconds


Lets the caster determine whether any one object is magical. If the spell
is successful, a second casting tells whether the magic is temporary or
permanent. A critical success on either roll fully identifies the spell, as
for :ref:`Analyze Magic <analyze_magic>`.

.. _aura:

Aura
====
Information

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Detect Magic <detect_magic>`
| **Classes**: Information
| **Cost**: 3 (for any size subject).

Shows the caster a glowing halo, or “aura,” around the subject. This aura
gives the caster a general insight into the subject’s personality – the better
the skill roll, the better the insight. The aura also shows whether the subject is
a mage (and about how powerful); whether the subject is possessed or controlled in any way; and whether
the subject is in the grip of any violent emotion. A critical success detects
“secret” traits, such as lycanthropy, vampirism, and unnatural longevity.

All living beings have auras; inanimate things do not. A zombie is
detectable by his faint, death-haunted aura, while a vampire retains the aura
he had in life. Illusions and created beings have no aura, so a successful
casting of this spell distinguishes them from real persons.

.. _seeker:


Seeker
======

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 1 <magery>`, IQ 12+, and at least two “Seek” spells (e.g., :ref:`Seek Earth <seek_earth>` and :ref:`Seek Water <seek_water>`).
| **Classes**: Information
| **Cost**: 3. One try per week.
| **Modifiers**: Long-distance modifiers Something associated with the item sought (e.g., part of a lost person’s clothing) should be available at the time of casting; if not, roll at -5. The roll is at +1 if the caster has held or is otherwise familiar with the item sought.

Attunes the caster to one individual or manmade object he is looking for. A
success gives the caster a vision of the item’s whereabouts – or leads him to
it, if it is within a mile.

To seek a person, the caster must either know his name or know him
well enough to visualize him. For instance, you cannot use this spell to
solve a murder by seeking “the murderer” if you don’t know who that is –
but if you do, Seeker will find him.


.. _trace:

Trace
=====

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Seeker <seeker>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Time to cast**: 1 minute.
| **Duration**: 1 hour.
| **Cost**: 3 to cast; 1 to maintain. One try per day.




May be cast on any object or living being. As long as the spell is maintained, the caster will know where the
subject is if he concentrates for a second. Either the subject must be with
the caster when the spell is first cast, or the caster must first cast Seeker
successfully. Long-distance modifiers apply if subject is not in caster’s presence.


.. _identify_spell:

Identify Spell
==============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Detect Magic <detect_magic>`
| **Classes**: Information
| **Cost**: 2.


Lets the caster know what spell or spells have just been cast (within the
last five seconds), or are being cast at the moment, on or by the subject. It
does not identify the spells on a permanently enchanted item. One casting
identifies all spells cast on or by the subject. However, if any of these spells
are totally unknown to the caster – not just spells he doesn’t know, but spells
he has never heard of – the GM should provide only a general, vague description;
e.g., “Some kind of physical protection.” Wizards have heard of every spell in
this list unless the GM rules that some are secret, but wizards have not heard
of new spells created by the GM or players.

.. _analyze_magic:

Analyze Magic
=============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Identify Spell <identify_spell>`
| **Classes**: Information; Resisted by spells that conceal magic
| **Cost**: 8.
| **Time to cast**: 1 hour.


Tells the caster exactly what spells are on the subject. If the subject has
more than one spell on it, Analyze Magic identifies the one that took the
least energy and tells the caster “there are more spells.” It can then be cast
again to determine the next spell, and so on. Like Identify Spell, above, it
gives limited results when faced with a spell the caster has never heard of.


******************
Light and Darkness
******************

These spells affect not just visible light, but also infrared and ultraviolet
light. Spells that provide illumination allow those with Infravision and
Ultravision to see, while spells that block ordinary vision also block those
senses.

=============================================== ======================= =========================================== ================================

.. _light:

Light
=====

| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Cost**: 1 to cast; 1 to maintain.

Produces a small light, like a candle flame. It stays still unless the caster
concentrates on moving it; then it can travel at Move 5.


.. _continual_light:

Continual Light
===============

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Light <light>`
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: Variable. Roll 2d for number of days. Does not count as a spell “on.”
| **Cost**: 2 for a dim glow, 4 for the brightness of a fire, 6 for a glare so bright as to be painful at close range.

When cast on a small object (up to fist-sized or 1 lb.) or a small part of a
larger object, this spell makes that object glow with white light.

.. _darkness:

Darkness
========
Area

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Continual Light <continual_light>`
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Base Cost**: 2 to cast; 1 to maintain.


Cloaks the area of effect in pitch darkness. A person inside the area can
see out normally, but can see nothing else within the area. Those outside the
area can see only darkness within.

Thus, attacks out of darkness suffer no penalty, but attacks into darkness are
at a penalty; see Visibility for combat rules.

The Dark Vision advantage lets you see through a Darkness spell, but Night Vision and Infravision do not.


.. _blur:

Blur
====
Regular

| **Prerequisite**: :ref:`Darkness <darkness>`
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 1 to 5 to cast; the same to maintain.
| **Time to cast**: 2 seconds.


This spell makes the subject harder to see and therefore harder to hit with
attacks. Each point of energy gives -1 to the effective skill of any attack on
the subject, to a maximum of -5.

These spells have to do with the structure of magic itself. They are
spells about spells, or spells that affect other spells.

.. _counterspell:

Counterspell
============

| **Prerequisite**: Magery 1.
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by subject spell
| **Time to cast**: 5 seconds.
| **Cost**: Half that of the spell countered, not counting bonuses the other caster got for high skill.


This spell nullifies any one ongoing spell. It cannot “counter” spells that
make a permanent change in the world (e.g., Extinguish Fire, Flesh to Stone,
or Zombie) and it cannot affect permanently enchanted items, but it can
counter spells cast using magic items.

The “subject” of Counterspell may be either the subject of the spell to be
countered or the person who cast that spell.

Counterspell is a single spell – but to counter a given spell, you must also
know that spell. Roll against the lower of your Counterspell skill or your skill
with the spell being countered. You must win a Quick Contest with the target spell
to cancel it. You can cast multiple Counterspells to negate an Area spell piece by piece.


.. _dispel_magic:

Dispel Magic
============

| **Prerequisite**: Counterspell and at least 12 other spells (any type).
| **Classes**: Area; Resisted by subject spells
| **Duration**: Dispelled magic is permanently gone.
| **Base Cost**: 3.
| **Time to cast**: 1 second for each energy point spent.

This spell, if successful, negates other spells within the area. It has no
effect on enchanted items – just on spells. Each spell resists separately.

Dispel Magic is not selective! The caster need not know the spell(s) being
dispelled. To nullify a specific spell without affecting others, use Counterspell.



************
Mind Control

These spells have no effect on subjects that lack intelligence (IQ 0) or
free will (in general, this means the Automaton meta-trait; see p. 263).

.. _foolishness:

Foolishness
===========

| **Prerequisite**: IQ 12+.
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by Will
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 1 to 5 to cast; half that amount to maintain (round up).

The subject suffers -1 to his IQ and IQ-based skills (including spells) for
every point of energy put into the spell. The GM may also require an IQ
roll to remember complex things while under the influence of this spell.


.. _forgetfulness:

Forgetfulness
=============

| **Prerequisite**: Magery 1 and Foolishness.
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by Will or skill
| **Duration**: 1 hour.
| **Cost**: 3 to cast; 3 to maintain.
| **Time to cast**: 10 seconds.

Causes the subject to forget one fact, skill, or spell temporarily. The
skill or spell cannot be used while Forgetfulness is in effect. If (for
instance) a forgotten spell is a prerequisite for other spells, the other spells
can still be used, at -2 to skill.


.. _daze:

Daze
====


| **Prerequisite**: Foolishness.
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 3 to cast; 2 to maintain.
| **Time to cast**: 2 seconds.


Subject looks and acts normal, but does not notice what is going on
around him, and will not remember it later. A dazed guard will stand quietly
while a thief walks past! Any injury, or successful resistance to a spell, causes
the subject to snap out of the daze and return to full, alert status.


.. _mass_daze:

Mass Daze
=========

| **Prerequisite**: Daze and IQ 13+.
| **Classes**: Area; Resisted by HT
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 3 to cast; 2 to maintain.
| **Time to cast**: 1 second for each energy point spent.
| **Base Cost**: 2 to cast; 1 to maintain. Minimum radius 2 yards.


As Daze, but can be cast over an area.


.. _sleep:

Sleep
=====

| **Prerequisite**: Daze.
| **Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT
| **Cost**: 4.
| **Time to cast**: 3 seconds.



Subject falls asleep. If standing, he falls – but this does not wake him. He
can be awakened by a blow, loud noise, etc., but will be mentally
stunned (see Effects of Stun, p. 420). The Awaken spell (p. 248) arouses him
instantly. If not awakened, he will sleep for around eight hours and
awaken normally.

.. _mass_sleep:

Mass Sleep
==========

| **Prerequisites**: Sleep and IQ 13+.
| **Classes**: Area; Resisted by HT
| **Base Cost**: 3. Minimum radius 2 yards.
| **Time to cast**: 1 second for each energy point spent.



As Sleep, but can be cast over an area.



.. _command:

Command
=======
| **Prerequisites**:  Magery 2 and Forgetfulness.
| **Classes**: Blocking; Resisted by Will
| **Cost**: 2.


Lets the caster give the subject one immediate command – a word and a
gesture, or at most two words – which the subject must obey. If the subject is
unable to fulfill the command immediately or on his next turn, the spell
has no effect.

Some examples:
 - “Drop it!” – the subject drops whatever he was holding.
 - “Look!” – the subject looks in the direction the caster indicates.
 - “Wait!” – the subject takes the Wait maneuver on his next turn.


********
Movement
********

These spells physically manipulate the subject or affect his movement
abilities.

Haste
=====

| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 2 to cast, and 1 to maintain, per point added to the subject’s Move and Dodge.
| **Time to cast**: 2 seconds.


Increases the subject’s Move and Dodge scores by up to 3.


.. _hinder_:

Hinder
======

Same as :ref:`Hinder <hinder>`

.. _great_haste:

Great Haste (VH)
================

| **Prerequisites**: Magery 1, IQ 12+, and Haste.
| **Classes**: Regular
| **Duration**: 10 seconds.
| **Cost**: 5. Cannot be maintained; must be recast. At the spell’s end, the subject also loses 5 FP (unless the caster was the subject).
| **Time to cast**: 3 seconds.


Speeds the subject up a lot. In effect, the subject has one level of Altered Time Rate (p. 38) for the duration of the spell.

.. _apportation:

Apportation
===========

| **Prerequisite**: Magery 1.
| **Classest**: Regular; Resisted by Will
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 1 for an object up to 1 lb. in weight; 2 for an object up to 10 lbs.; 3 for an object up to 50 lbs.; 4 for an object up to 200 lbs.;  and 4 for each additional 100 lbs. Cost to maintain is the same.

Lets the caster move physical objects without touching them. This spell levitates its subject at Move 1 –
not fast enough to do damage with it. Living subjects get to resist with Will.


.. _lockmaster:

Lockmaster
==========

| **Prerequisite**s: Magery 2 and Apportation.
| **Classest**: Regular; Resisted by Magelock
| **Duration**: Once opened, a lock stays open until closed.
| **Cost**: 3. Cannot be maintained.
| **Time to cast**: 10 seconds.

Opens locks magically. A Magelock spell gets a roll to resist Lockmaster.
Any modifiers for the difficulty of the lock that would apply Lockpicking
skill also affect this spell.



.. _deflect_missile:

Deflect Missile
===============


| **Prerequisite**: Apportation.
| **Classest**: Blocking
| **Cost**: 1.

Deflects one missile about to hit the subject – including any Missile spell.
Counts as a parry for combat purposes. If the caster is not the subject,
apply distance modifiers as for a Regular spell. Deflected attacks may
still hit a target beyond the subject.

dead, and spirits. They affect corpses
and spirits of all races, unless other-
wise noted in a racial description.

.. _death_vision:

Death Vision
============

| **Prerequisite**: Magery 1.
| **Classest**: Regular
| **Duration**: 1 second.
| **Cost**: 2.
| **Time to cast**: 3 seconds.


The subject sees a vivid presentiment of his own death. This might be
a vision of the future or a false vision from another possible future – but it is
always chilling. The subject is mentally stunned until he can make his IQ
roll to shake off the effects of the spell.

This spell can also be useful to the subject, by pointing out a possibly deadly hazard.


.. _sense_spirit:

Sense Spirit
============

| **Prerequisite**: Death Vision. Information; Area
| **Base Cost**: 1/2.

Tells the caster if there are any ghosts, spirits, undead, or similar
supernatural entities within the area of effect. On a good roll, it gives a general
impression of what kind of being is present. Caster may, at the time of
casting, limit the spell to a specific type of entity, or exclude a given type.


.. _summon_spirit:

Summon Spirit
=============

| **Prerequisite**s: Magery 2 and Death Vision. Information; Resisted by spirit’s Will
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 20 to cast; 10 to maintain. Halve these costs if the spell is cast at the site of death or over the corpse of the person being contacted.
| **Time to cast**: 5 minutes.


Lets the caster talk to the spirit of a dead person. The subject resists at -5 if
he was a friend of the caster. If the spell succeeds, the subject will answer
one question, to the best of his knowledge as of the time he died, and one
more per minute he remains.

If the spell fails, that caster (or ceremonial group) may not summon that
spirit again for one year. A critical failure means the caster summoned a
malign spirit, who lies deliberately.

Modifiers: -5 if you don’t know the subject’s full name. -1 if it has been
more than a week since the subject’s death, -2 if more than a month, -3 if
more than a year, -4 if more than 10 years, -5 if more than 50 years, and -6
if more than 500 years.

.. _zombie:

Zombie
======

| **Prerequisite**s: Summon Spirit and Lend Vitality.
| **Classest**: Regular
| **Duration**: The zombie remains animated until destroyed.
| **Cost**: 8, multiplied by 1 + SM for creatures larger than human-sized.
| **Time to cast**: 1 minute.


The subject of this spell must be a relatively complete dead body. The
condition of the corpse determines the result: a fresh body produces a zom-
bie, a skeleton produces an animated skeleton, and an old, dry body produces
a walking mummy. The animated corpse becomes an undead servant
of the caster. It attributes are based on those of the original body, as are its
physical advantages and DX-based skills. It does not have the “soul,” mental
traits, IQ-based skills, or memories of the living person. The GM determines
its exact abilities, as appropriate to the campaign.


.. _turn_zombie:

Turn Zombie
===========

| **Prerequisite**: Zombie. (This spell is common among those who have Power Investiture.)
| **Classest**: Area
| **Duration**: Successfully turned undead will avoid the caster for one day.
| **Base Cost**: 2. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.
| **Time to cast**: 4 seconds.


Inflicts 1d of injury on anything in the area that was animated using the
Zombie spell; DR does not protect. In addition, roll 1d for each zombie. On a
1, it turns and flees from the caster.



.. _summon_demon:

Summon Demon
============

| **Prerequisite**s: Magery 1 and at least one spell from each of 10 different colleges.
| **Classest**: Special
| **Time to cast**: 5 minutes.
| **Duration**: Until the demon’s task is done, or one hour, whichever is less.
| **Cost**: 1 point per 10 character points used to build the demon. Minimum energy cost is 20 (although this will not always summon a 200-point being). Those tempted to summon powerful demons should bear inmind that such demons tend to have high Will, with all that implies for control ...

This is the version of Planar Summons that raises demons;
see that spell description for details. If the caster fails to control the demon, it
always attacks him! If he manages to control the demon and give it a command,
the demon carries out the letter of its orders, doing its best to pervert
their spirit to the caster’s disfavor. It also works incidental mischief, unless
specifically instructed not to.


.. _banish:

Banish
======

| **Prerequisite**s: Magery 1 and at least one spell from each of 10 different colleges.
| **Classest**: Special; Resisted by Will
| **Cost**: 1 point per 10 character points the subject is worth. Minimum energy cost is 10. The caster does not know in advance how much energy the spell will require, and may fall unconscious or even wound himself in casting the Banish.
| **Time to cast**: 5 seconds.
| **Modifiers**: +4 if the caster knows the entity’s “true name”; -5 if the caster does not know the subject’s plane of origin ... and an extra -1 if he believes he knows where the creature came from, but is wrong!

This spell sends an extradimensional visitor (e.g., a demon) back to
its plane of origin. It can only be cast if the caster is in his home dimension.
In an alien plane, you could not “banish” yourself back home, but a native
of that plane could banish you. This spell does not work on a creature that
is already in its home dimension.

Resolve the Banish attempt as a Quick Contest: the caster’s Banish skill
vs. the subject’s Will. If the caster wins, the subject immediately returns to its
home plane. It cannot return for one month. Anything that it brought with
it when it appeared (e.g., weapons) vanishes with it. Other things it may
be carrying (e.g., screaming victims) stay behind. Note that certain powerful creatures
are resistant or even immune to this spell.

Shield
======

| **Prerequisite**: Magery 2.
| **Classest**: Regular
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: Twice the Defense Bonus given to the subject, to a maximum DB of 4 (cost 8); half that to maintain.

Conjures an invisible shield of magicaв  force that moves to protect
the subject from frontal attacks. The Defense Bonus granted by this spell is
cumulative with that from an actual shield, but this spell does not allow a
subject without a shield to block.

.. _armor:

Armor
=====

| **Prerequisite**s: Magery 2 and Shield.
| **Classest**: Regular
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: Twice the Damage Resistance given to the subject, to a maximum DR of 5 (cost 10); half that to maintain.

Adds to the Damage Resistance of a living subject. DR from this spell is
treated for all purposes like DR from armor, and is cumulative with that
from actual armor.


.. _magelock:

Magelock
========

| **Prerequisite**: Magery 1.
| **Classest**: Regular; Resists Lockmaster spell
| **Duration**: 6 hours.
| **Cost**: 3 to cast; 2 to maintain.
| **Time to cast**: 4 seconds.


Locks a door magically. The door will not open unless the spell is
removed (Counterspell and Lockmaster are both able to counter
it) or the door itself is destroyed.

.. _seek_water:

Seek Water
==========

| **Classest**: Information


This spell lets the caster determine the direction, distance, and general
nature of the nearest significant source of water. Use the long-distance
modifiers (p. 241). Any known sources of water may be excluded if the caster
specifically mentions them before beginning. Requires a forked stick;
roll at -3 if this is not available.

.. _purify_water:

Purify Water
============

| **Prerequisite**: Seek Water.
| **Classest**: Special
| **Duration**: Purified water stays pure unless re-contaminated.
| **Cost**: 1 per gallon purified.
| **Time to cast**: Usually 5 to 10 seconds per gallon, unless a large container and ring are used.

Lets the caster remove all impurities from water by pouring it through
any hoop or ring (or, in a pinch, his own fingers) into a container. Only
one skill roll is required, as long as the flow continues.



.. _create_water:

Create Water
============
| **Prerequisite**: Purify Water.
| **Classest**: Regular
| **Duration**: The created water is permanent.
| **Cost**: 2 per gallon created.


Lets the caster create pure water out of nothing. This water may appear
in any of several forms. It may appear within a container, or as a globe in
midair (it falls immediately). Or it may appear as a dense mist of
droplets; in this form, one gallon of water extinguishes all fires in a one-yard
radius. Water cannot be created inside a foe to drown him!

.. _destroy_water:

Destroy Water
=============
| **Prerequisite**: Create Water.
| **Classest**: Area
| **Duration**: Permanent.
| **Base Cost**: 3. In deep water, the area is only 2 yards in height (or depth).


Causes water (in any form) to vanish, leaving a vacuum – or perhaps
specks of dry impurities. If more water is all around, it rushes in to fill
the hole. Good for drying things out, saving a drowning victim, etc. Cannot
be used as a “dehydrating” attack on a foe.


.. _breathe_water_2:

Breathe Water
=============

Same as :ref:`Breathe water <breathe_water`>

.. _shape_water:

Shape Water
===========

| **Prerequisite**: Create Water.
| **Classest**: Regular
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 1 per 20 gallons shaped; same cost to maintain.
| **Time to cast**: 2 seconds.


Lets the caster sculpt water (including ice or steam) into any form,
and even move it about. Once given a shape, the water holds it without further
concentration until the spell ends. Water moved with this spell travels at
Move 3. A useful shape is a wall of water to stop fiery attacks. Twenty gallons creates
a wall 2 yards high ¥ 1 yard wide. This stops Fireball spells and ordinary fire.


.. _fog:

Fog
===

| **Prerequisite**: Shape Water.
| **Classest**: Area
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Base Cost**: 2; half that to maintain.


Creates an area of dense fog. Even one yard of fog blocks vision. Flaming
weapons and missiles lose their extra power in fog. A Fireball loses 1 point of
damage per yard of fog it must traverse (e.g., a 3d Fireball that crosses 5 yards
of fog inflicts 3d-5 damage), while victims of an Explosive Fireball may
count each yard of fog as two yards of distance from the blast. However, no
amount of fog can extinguish a fire.


.. _icy_weapon:

Icy Weapon
==========

| **Prerequisite**: Create Water.
| **Duration**: 1 minute.
| **Cost**: 3 to cast; 1 to maintain.
| **Time to cast**: 3 seconds.


Causes any weapon to become freezing cold. This does not harm the
user or the weapon, but an attack with the weapon does +2 damage to most
foes if it penetrates DR. Multiply this bonus for any Vulnerability (p. 161) to
ice or cold. Add this bonus to the final injury inflicted by the attack – for
instance, an “impaling” icy attack is still only good for +2 damage, not +4.
