=============================================== ======================= =========================================== ================================



.. _purify_air:

Purify Air
==========

**Prerequisite**: None

**Classes**: Area

**Duration**: Works instantly. Purification is permanent.

**Base Cost**: 1. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

This spell removes all impurities from the air in its area of effect. It is
often used to neutralize the effects of poisonous gas or vapors. Note that a
room full of smoke may safely be purified one section at a time – but truly
deadly vapors must all be removed at once, or some may escape.
This spell also turns old “stale” air into fresh breathable air. The air in a
one-yard radius, if not renewed from the outside, will last 45 minutes for
one person at rest, less for multiple persons or someone violently
exercising (GM’s discretion)



.. _create_air:

Create Air
==========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Purify Air <purify_air>`

**Classes**: Area

**Duration**: Breeze, bubbles, etc. last 5 seconds. Air created is permanent.

**Base Cost**: 1. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

This spell manufactures air where none exists. When cast where there is
already air, it produces an outward breeze lasting about five seconds.
When cast in a vacuum, it instantly creates breathable air. When cast
within earth, stone, or other material, it fills any empty spaces with air, but
does not burst the stone. When cast underwater, it makes bubbles!
It cannot be cast inside a living being.



.. _shape_air:

Shape Air
=========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Create Air <purify_air>`

**Classes**: Regular

**Duration**: 1 minute.

**Cost**: 1 to 10. 1 produces a gentle breeze; 4 a wind; 6 a heavy wind; 8 or
more a violent blast. Cost to maintain is the same as to cast.

This spell lets the caster create movements of air over a small area.
The caster must choose a starting point (calculate distance penalties to
that point). The wind starts there and blows in a stream one yard wide, for a
distance in yards equal to 5 times the energy put into the spell, and then
dissipates. This may cause knockback (see Knockback, p. 378) on someone it
hits; each second, roll 1d per full 2 points of energy in the spell. Treat this
as damage for knockback purposes only (this spell does not cause injury).



.. _no_smell:

No-Smell
========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Purify Air <purify_air>`

**Classes**: Regular

**Duration**: 1 hour.

**Cost**: 2; same to maintain.

Removes the subject’s odor and makes it (or him) totally undetectable
by smell. Any possessions are also affected. This spell changes no other
properties of the subject.



.. _predict_weather:

Predict Weather
===============

**Prerequisites**: At least four Air spells.

**Cost**: Twice the length of the forecast, in days. Double the cost for a
location outside the general area (say, over the horizon). Quadruple the cost
for a place on another continent. This spell cannot predict weather on other
planets or planes.

**Time to cast**: 5 seconds per day forecast.

Lets the caster forecast the weather accurately for a given location over a
given time. This forecast does not take magical meddling into account, or
predict the actions of other wizards!



.. _breathe_water:

Breathe Water
=============

**Prerequisites**: :ref:`Create Air <create_air>` and :ref:`Destroy water <destroy_water>`

**Duration**: 1 minute.

**Cost**: 4 to cast; 2 to maintain.

Lets the subject breathe water as though it were air. Subject does
not lose the ability to breathe ordinary air! This spell is also considered a Water
spell.



.. _walk_on_air:

Walk on Air
===========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Shape Air <shape_air>`

**Duration**: 1 minute.

**Cost**: 3 to cast; 2 to maintain.

Temporarily grants the subject the Walk on Air advantage (...). If the
subject falls for any reason (e.g., injury), the spell is broken! If the spell
is recast immediately, he falls for only one second (about 5 yards) and then
“lands” on the air (taking 1d damage) – unless he hits ground before then. If
he’s 10 feet over a lava pit, too bad!




.. _earth_to_air:

Earth to Air
============

**Prerequisites**: :ref:`Create Air <create_air>` and :ref:`Shape Earth <shape_earth>`

**Duration**: Permanent.

**Cost**: 1 to transform one cubic foot of earth/stone to air, giving enough air
for one person to breathe for 1 minute. To transform larger quantities
of earth/stone at once, the cost is 5 per cubic yard.

**Time to cast**: 2 seconds.

This spell turns earth or stone into air, which can be valuable to someone
who is trapped underground! The more energy the caster spends, the
more earth he can transform, but he is limited to regular shapes with the
largest dimension no more than four times the smallest one. This spell is
also considered an Earth spell.




.. _stench:

Stench
======

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Purify Air <purify_air>`

**Duration**: 5 minutes, except in windy areas.

**Base Cost**: 1. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

Produces a cloud of vile, yellowish gas that reeks of brimstone. Until it
dissipates, anyone who breathes it must make a HT roll or take 1d damage.
Roll once per minute. Those in the area also begin to suffocate (see Suffocation ...).
The cloud is heavy, and “rolls” downhill if the ground is not level. The rate of
dissipation depends on the area and presence of wind; indoors, it usually lasts
until the spell expires, but outdoors on a windy day, it might only last 10 seconds or so.




.. _lightning:

Lightning
=========

**Prerequisites**: :ref:`Magery 1 <magery>` and at least six other Air spells.

**Cost**: Any amount up to your Magery level per second, for three seconds.
The bolt does 1d-1 burning damage per energy point.

**Time to cast**: 1 to 3 seconds (the caster’s fingers sparkle as the spell
builds up).

Lets the caster shoot a bolt of lightning from his fingertip.
This has 1/2D 50, Max 100, Acc 3. Treat any metal
armor as DR 1 against this spell! If the target is wounded, he must make a HT
roll, at -1 per 2 HP suffered, or be stunned. He may attempt a HT roll
each turn thereafter to recover. Against electronic equipment, treat
this attack as if it had the Surge damage modifier (see Surge, ...).
Lightning behaves unpredictably around conductors. A lightning bolt
cannot be fired through a metal grid, between bars, from within a car, etc. –
it jumps to the metal and is lost. However, the GM may (for instance)
allow a wizard to shoot a lightning bolt into a metal floor. This would not
electrocute those on it, but could shock them all, interrupting
concentration and doing slight damage (no more than 1 point, and possibly none
at all). The GM may encourage creative use of lightning until it becomes
a nuisance ...




.. _itch:

Itch
====

**Prerequisite**: None

**Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT

**Duration**: Until the subject takes a turn to scratch.

**Cost**: 2. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

Causes the subject to itch fiercely in a spot of the caster’s choice. The
subject is at -2 DX until he takes one full turn to scratch (more, if armor,
etc. is in the way!). Only one Itch spell can affect a given subject at a time.



.. _spasm:

Spasm
=====

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Itch <itch>`

**Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT

**Duration**: A moment.

**Cost**: 2. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

Can be directed against any of the subject’s voluntary
muscles. Directed against a hand, it causes the subject to
drop whatever he is holding (usually a weapon). If the subject is in the middle
of a lengthy spell requiring gestures, he must make a DX roll or start
over. Ingenious casters will find other uses...



.. _pain:

Pain
====

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Spasm <spasm>`

**Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT

**Duration**: 1 second.

**Cost**: 2. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

The subject feels a stab of agonizing pain. He must make a Will roll to
avoid crying out. If he is in a precarious position (climbing, for instance),
he must make a DX roll to avoid catastrophe! His DX and all DX-based skills
are at -3 for the next turn only. If the subject is in the middle of a spell
requiring gestures, he must roll vs. Will or start over. High Pain Threshold
gives +3 to the Will and DX rolls above; Low Pain Threshold gives -4.



.. _clumsiness:

Clumsiness
==========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Spasm <spasm>`

**Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT

**Duration**: 1 minute.

**Cost**: 1 to 5 to cast; half that amount to maintain (round up).

The subject suffers -1 to his DX and DX-based skills for every point of
energy put into the spell.



.. _hinder:

Hinder
======

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Clumsiness <clumsiness>` or :ref:`Haste <haste>`

**Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT

**Duration**: 1 minute.

**Cost**: 1 to 4 to cast; same to maintain.

The subject is at -1 to his Move and Dodge scores for every point of energy
put into the spell. This spell is also considered a Movement spell.



.. _rooted_feet:

Rooted Feet
===========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Hinder <hinder>`

**Classes**: Regular; Resisted by ST

**Duration**: 1 minute, or until subject breaks free.

**Cost**: 3. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

The subject’s feet are glued in place! He may try another resistance
roll at -5 every turn, against the original spell skill roll, to break free. While
the spell continues, the subject’s skill with any weapon except a ranged
weapon is at -2 and his Dodge score is cut in half (round down).



.. _paralyze_limb:

Paralyze Limb
=============

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 1 <magery>` and five Body Control spells,
including :ref:`Pain <pain>`

**Classes**: Melee; Resisted by HT

**Duration**: 1 minute.

**Cost**: 3. Cannot be maintained; must be recast.

The caster must strike the subject on a limb to trigger this spell (hits elsewhere
have no effect). Armor does not protect. Resolve resistance on contact.
If the caster wins, the subject’s limb is paralyzed; it is considered crippled for
one minute.



.. _wither_limb:

Wither Limb
===========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 2 <magery>` and :ref:`Paralyze Limb <paralyze_limb>`

**Classes**: Melee; Resisted by HT

**Duration**: Permanent unless healed magically.

**Cost**: 5.

The caster must strike the subject on a limb to trigger this spell.
Armor does not protect. Resolve resistance on contact. If the caster wins, the subject’s
limb withers immediately; it is crippled for all purposes. The subject also takes 1d damage.



.. _deathtouch:

Deathtouch
==========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Wither Limb <wither_limb>`

**Classes**: Melee

**Cost**: 1 to 3.

The caster must strike the subject to trigger this spell; hit location is
irrelevant. The subject takes 1d damage per point of energy in the spell.
Armor does not protect. This spell does affect the undead.




.. _sense_foes:

Sense Foes
==========

**Prerequisite**: None

**Classes**: Information; Area

**Base Cost**: 1 (minimum 2).

Tells the caster if the subject has hostile intent, and what the degree of
hostility is. Can be cast on one person or a whole area. If cast over an area,
this spell only detects that someone is hostile, without telling who.



.. _sense_emotion:

Sense Emotion
=============

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Sense Foes <sense_foes>`

**Classes**: Regular

**Cost**: 2.

Lets the caster know what emotions the subject is feeling at the
moment. It works on any living being, but is not much use except on sapient
creatures! This also tells how loyal the subject is to the caster (see
Loyalty of Hirelings, ...).



.. _truthsayer:

Truthsayer
==========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Sense Emotion <sense_emotion>`

**Classes**: Information; Resisted by Will

**Cost**: 2.

This tells whether the subject is lying or not. May be cast in two ways:
1. To tell whether the subject has told any lies in the last five minutes.
2. To tell whether the last thing the subject said was a lie. May also give an indication of how
great the lie is. If the caster is not touching the subject, calculate range
as for a Regular spell.



.. _mind_reading:

Mind-Reading
============

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Truthsayer <truthsayer>`

**Classes**: Regular; Resisted by Will

**Duration**: 1 minute.

**Cost**: 4 to cast; 2 to maintain.

**Time to cast**: 10 seconds.

Lets the caster read the subject’s mind. Works on any living being, but
is most useful on sapient creatures. Detects only surface thoughts (what
the subject is thinking at that moment). The subject is not aware his
mind is being read, except in the case of a critical failure. Modifiers: -
2 if the caster does not know the subject’s native language; -2 if the subject
is of a different race – or -4 or more if the subject is totally alien!




.. _hide_thoughts:

Hide Thoughts
=============

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Truthsayer <truthsayer>`

**Classes**: Regular

**Duration**: 10 minutes.

**Cost**: 3 to cast; 1 to maintain.

This spell resists all mind-reading and thought-control attempts on the
subject. The “attacking” ability must win a Quick Contest against this spell
in order to affect the subject. If the attacking ability pierces Hide
Thoughts, the subject still gets his normal resistance roll (roll separately).
This spell does not affect previously established mental control.




.. _seek_earth:

Seek Earth
==========

**Prerequisite**: None

**Classes**: Information

**Cost**: 3.

**Time to cast**: 10 seconds.

This spell tells the caster the direction and approximate distance of the nearest
significant amount of any one type of earth, metal, or stone. Use the
long-distance modifiers (...). Any known sources of that material may
be excluded if the caster specifically mentions them before beginning.



.. _shape_earth:

Shape Earth
===========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Seek Earth <seek_earth>`

**Classes**: Regular

**Duration**: 1 minute.

**Cost**: 1 per cubic yard of earth shaped (minimum 2); half that to
maintain (round up).

Lets the caster move earth and shape it into any form. If the form is
stable (e.g., a hill), it remains permanently after shaping. An unstable form
(e.g., a column or wall) lasts only while the spell continues – no special
concentration is required – and then collapses.

Earth moved with this spell travels at only Move 2. It can harm no one
except by flowing over an immobile person and burying him. If earth is
moved onto a person to bury him – or from beneath him, to create a hole –
he may move normally on his next turn, to escape. He is trapped only if
he fails to do so.

Anyone buried by this spell may try to claw his way out of the loose earth.
One roll, at ST-4, is allowed per turn. GMs may make this roll harder if the
victim is buried under more than two cubic yards of earth! The victim can
hold his breath (see Holding Your Breath, ...), but he eventually risks
suffocation (see Suffocation, ...).


.. _earth_to_stone:

Earth to Stone
==============

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 1 <magery>` and :ref:`Shape Earth <shape_earth>`

**Classes**: Regular

**Duration**: Permanent.

**Cost**: 3 per cubic yard (minimum 3).

Turns an item of earth or clay into hard stone (but not gemstone).



.. _create_earth:

Create Earth
============

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Earth to Stone <earth_to_stone>`

**Classes**: Regular

**Duration**: Permanent.

**Cost**: 2 per cubic yard to create earth from nothingness (minimum 2);
1 per cubic yard to solidify mud into good earth (minimum 1).

Lets the caster create good, solid earth where none existed before. This
earth must be created in contact with the ground – not hanging in the air or
floating in the sea!



.. _flesh_to_stone:

Flesh to Stone
==============

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Earth to Stone <earth_to_stone>`

**Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT

**Duration**: Permanent, unless reversed by Stone to Flesh.

**Cost**: 10.

**Time to cast**: 2 seconds.

“Petrifies” a living subject (and all his gear!), turning him to stone. Must
affect the entire subject.



.. _stone_to_earth:

Stone to Earth
==============

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Earth to Stone <earth_to_stone>` or any 4 Earth spells

**Classes**: Regular

**Duration**: Permanent.

**Cost**: 6 per cubic yard (minimum 6).

Turns any kind of stone (including gemstone) into simple earth. Must be
cast on a whole stone or block, rather than a part of it.



.. _stone_to_flesh:

Stone to Flesh
==============

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 2 <magery>`, :ref:`Flesh to Stone <flesh_to_stone>`
and :ref:`Stone to Earth <stone_to_earth>`

**Classes**: Regular

**Duration**: Permanent.

**Cost**: 10.

**Time to cast**: 5 seconds.

Reverses the effects of Flesh to Stone and brings the victim back to life
(stunned). Cannot be used to animate a statue that was never alive.




.. _entombment:

Entombment
==========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 2 <magery>` and 5 Earth spells.

**Classes**: Regular; Resisted by HT

**Duration**: Permanent, unless reversed by this spell.

**Cost**:  10 (but only 6 to reverse an entombment).

**Time to cast**: 3 seconds.

The earth instantly swallows the subject. He remains in suspended
animation, in a tiny spherical chamber 50 feet underground, until rescued
by tunneling or the reverse of this spell. A mage who casts Entombment
on himself may elect to stay awake, but this is unwise unless he also
knows Earth to Air!



.. _ignite_fire:

Ignite Fire
===========

**Prerequisite**: None

**Classes**: Regular

**Duration**: One second.

**Cost**: Depends on the amount of heat desired:

1 – for an effect as though a match had been held to the subject: lights a
candle, pipe, or tinder in one second.

2 – for an effect as though a torch had been held to the subject: ignites
paper or loose cloth in one second, ordinary clothes being worn in four
seconds.

3 – for an effect as though a blowtorch had been held to the subject:
ignites dry firewood or clothes being worn in one second, leather in two
seconds, heavy wood in six seconds.

4 – for an effect as though burning magnesium or phosphorus had been
held to the subject: ignites coal in one second, heavy wood in two seconds.

Cost to maintain is the same as the original cost to cast.

This spell produces a single spot of heat, and is used to set fire to a
readily flammable object. It works best on paper and cloth, and cannot affect any
item that would not burn in an ordinary fire. In particular, it cannot set
fire to a living being! Once ignited, the fire burns normally.




.. _create_fire:

Create Fire
===========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Ignite Fire <ignite_fire>`

**Classes**: Area

**Duration**: 1 minute.

**Base Cost**: 2; half that to maintain. Ordinary fires set by this spell do not
require maintenance.

Fills the area of effect with fire that requires no fuel (if cast in midair, it
produces a sphere of flame, which falls to the ground). This is real fire,
and will eventually ignite any flammable objects it touches. Cannot be cast
within rock, foes, etc.



.. _shape_fire:

Shape Fire
==========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Ignite Fire <ignite_fire>`

**Classes**: Area

**Duration**: 1 minute.

**Base Cost**: 2; half that to maintain.

Lets the caster control the shape of any flame. Each shape change requires
a second of concentration. Once shaped, the flame keeps that shape
until the spell expires, without concentration. Moving a flame requires constant
concentration (the flame moves at Move 5, on the caster’s turn). A natural
fire cannot move to a place that it can’t burn, but flame made with the
Create Fire spell needs no fuel and can move almost anywhere.

Flame shaped with this spell normally retains its volume. If the fire is
“spread out” across twice its original area, it only does half damage; if
spread across three times its original area, it does 1/3 damage, and so on.



.. _deflect_energy:

Deflect Energy
==============

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 2 <magery>` and :ref:`Shape Fire <shape_fire>`

**Classes**: Blocking

**Cost**: 1.

Deflects one energy attack about to hit the subject – including a beam
weapon attack or a Fireball or Lightning spell. Counts as a parry for
combat purposes. If the caster is not the subject, apply distance modifiers as
for a Regular spell. Deflected attacks may still hit a target beyond the subject.



.. _extinguish_fire:

Extinguish Fire
===============

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Ignite Fire <ignite_fire>`

**Classes**: Area

**Duration**: Once out, a fire stays out.

**Base Cost**: 3.

Puts out all ordinary and magical fires in its area of effect. Has no effect
on molten steel, lava, plasma, etc.



.. _heat:

Heat
====

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Create Fire <create_fire>` and :ref:`Shape Fire <shape_fire>`

**Classes**: Regular

**Duration**: 1 minute. Each minute raises the target’s temperature by 20°.
Maximum temperature possible with this spell is 2,800°.

**Cost**: 1 for an object up to the size of a fist, 2 for an object up to one cubic
yard, and 2 per cubic yard for a larger object. Temperature change can be
doubled to 40° per minute for double cost, tripled to 60°  per minute for
triple cost, and so on. Slower heating costs no less. Same cost to maintain.

**Time to cast**: 1 minute.

This spell raises the temperature of an object. It does not necessarily produce
fire, though most things burn if heated enough. Heat radiates away
normally. (Use this as a guideline for playable effects – don’t try to turn the
spell into a physics exercise!)

Any wizard planning to make extensive use of this
spell should arm himself with a list of the melting points of various materials. The spell
can have drawbacks. If you were in jail, you might melt your way through
the bars ... but the radiated heat would probably broil you first.



.. _cold:

Cold
====

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Heat <heat>`

**Classes**: Regular

Duration, Cost, and Time to cast: As for :ref:`Heat <heat>`, except each minute
lowers the target’s temperature by 20°.

This spell is the reverse of Heat (above). It can reduce the temperature
of any object to absolute zero, if maintained for long enough.



.. _resist_cold:

Resist Cold
===========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Heat <heat>`

**Classes**: Regular

**Duration**: 1 minute.

**Cost**: 2 to cast; 1 to maintain. Cost doubles if subject must resist cold of
-40° or more; cost triples if subject must resist the cold of absolute zero.

The subject (person, creature, or object) and anything he carries
become immune to the effects of cold and frostbite (but not falling ice,
magical ice spears, etc.).



.. _resist_fire:

Resist Fire
===========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Extinguish Fire <extinguish_fire>` and :ref:`Cold <cold>`

**Classes**: Regular

**Duration**: 1 minute.

**Cost**: 2 to cast; 1 to maintain. Cost doubles if subject must resist a blast
furnace or volcano; cost triples if subject must resist the heat of a star,
nuclear bomb, etc. Only the first level of protection is necessary against
combat-type Fire spells.

The subject (person, creature, or object) and anything he carries
become immune to the effects of heat and fire (but not electricity).



.. _fireball:

Fireball
========

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Magery 2 <magery>`, :ref:`Create Fire <create_fire>`
and :ref:`Shape Fire <shape_fire>`

**Classes**: Missile

**Cost**: Any amount up to your Magery level per second, for three seconds.
The fireball does 1d burning damage per energy point.

**Time to cast**: 1 to 3 seconds.

Lets the caster throw a ball of fire from his hand. This has 1/2D 25, Max
50, Acc 1. When it strikes something, it vanishes in a puff of flame. This spell is
likely to ignite flammable targets.


.. _explosive_fireball:

Explosive Fireball
==================

**Prerequisite**: :ref:`Fireball <fireball>`

**Classes**: Missile

**Cost**: Any amount up to twice your Magery level per second, for three seconds.
The fireball does 1d burning damage per full 2 points of energy.

**Time to cast**: 1 to 3 seconds.

Creates a fireball that affects both its target and things nearby. This has
1/2D 25, Max 50, Acc 1. Can be thrown at a wall, floor, etc. (at +4 to hit) to
catch foes in the blast. The target and anyone closer to the target than one
yard take full damage. Those further away divide damage by 3 times their
distance in yards (round down).
